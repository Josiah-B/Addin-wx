Tentatively planned Plugins / Features: (These are in no particular order)
	SQL DataBase Connectivity for Data Logging / Graphing
	WUnderground Radar and Forecast
	USB / TCP/IP Webcam Support
	Re-hosting of Weather Stations over TCP/IP (ie. if you have a Serial Connection to the WX Station, then this would allow TCP/IP Connections to be made to the Station)
	(Plugin) Weather Alarms
	(Plugin) Ocean Tide Forecasts
	(Plugin) A fully customizable display (It would be setup so the user can choose what they want, where and how big.) I might add a separate program to create the displays, while still integrating the loading and displaying of the Screen layout in the main Program.
	(Plugin) Alarms. These would have user definable thresholds and user definable alarm type/output. ie. the user could set the alarm to send a string out a specific Serial Port, play an audio file, beep, or make something change color or flash.
	(Plugin) A full SQL server client for data logging. Would have semi macro based configuration for setting which values to log where. and Add a way to view the Logged data.
	(Plugin) Data Graphing
	(Plugin) Create a plugin that can utilize this weather map (http://earth.nullschool.net)
	(Plugin) Support for the SteelSeries Gauges
